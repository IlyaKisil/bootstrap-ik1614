## Overview
Directory with custom scripts which can be executed directly from shell, since this directory is most added to `$PATH`. Most of the scripts can display help message `some_script.sh -h` or `some_script.sh --help` which provides more detailed information and use cases.

In order to decrease chances of this scripts names shadowing system names/packages, it is advised to use extension `.sh`

## Custom scripts
-   `make-pdf.sh`
-   `start-jupyter.sh`
-   `re.sh`
-   `add-secret-environment-variable.sh`
-   `load-secret-environment-variable.sh`
