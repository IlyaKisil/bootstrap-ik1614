# Bootstrap configs
[![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-love.svg)](https://github.com/IlyaKisil)

This repository contains various configuration file and scripts for quick setup of a
working environment.

Ideally, bootstrap configurations should be idempotent. That is, the installer should be
able to be run multiple times without causing any problems. This makes a lot of things
easier to do (in particular, syncing updates between machines becomes really easy).

## Quick setups

:exclamation: **Important:** You need to have `PyYAML` installed before trying to install
profile or configuration.

### Setup dotfiles
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IlyaKisil/bootstrap-ik1614.git
cd bootstrap-ik1614

# Apply profile, i.e. a collection of configs
./install-profile.sh default-cli

# Apply selected configs
./install-config.sh git tmux zsh sh-aliases bin

# Verify the corresponding parts are configures correctly
./tests/verify-setup.sh
```

### Setup iTerm2
* Use [misc/iterm2/mdracula.itermcolors](./misc/iterm2/mdracula.itermcolors) which kinda
  replicates Dracula theme from JetBrains products. It will also match `mdracula` color
  scheme for vim.

* Imort [misc/iterm2/profile-mdracula.json](./misc/iterm2/profile-mdracula.json) and set
  it as default profile. You might need to install fonts ðŸ¤·


## Post install actions
### Nvim

```bash
pyenv install 3.9.4
pyenv global 3.9.4
pip install neovim

nvm install node
npm install -g neovim

nvim -c ':check health provider'
```
#### TODO
- [ ] There is a bad dependency in mapping on a plugin that are not installed and getting
  sourced only after
- [ ] Intall nvr for latex sync???
- [ ] Install lsp automatically???


### Install useful npm packages
```
â”œâ”€â”€ commitizen@4.0.3
â”œâ”€â”€ conventional-changelog-cli@2.1.1
â”œâ”€â”€ cz-conventional-changelog@3.1.0
â”œâ”€â”€ doctoc@1.4.0
â”œâ”€â”€ standard-version@9.3.0
â””â”€â”€ wscat@4.0.0
```


### `gcloud`
```bash
gcloud init ...

gcloud components install cloud_sql_proxy

gcloud auth application-default login
```


## Overview of this configuration files and scripts
### dotfiles
### dotfiles-meta
### setup-utils
### bin
### misc
### tests


## Development
Testing out new configuration can easily be done within Docker.
In this way, you don't risk of accidentally overriding your existing dotfiles of configs.
```bash
make test-install-config
# or
make test-install-profile
```
:exclamation: **Important:** Some of the configs are git submodules, i.e. `tpm`,
`oh-my-zsh`. However, we don't want our install bash scripts, i.e. `install-profile`,
`install-config`,  to pull/update them as a default behaviour, since we don't want to
overload different environments. Thus, this should be manged as a stand-alone task within
`shell` directive of a config.


## Reporting problems and issues

Please use one of [these forms][this-repo-issues] which supports `markdown` text
formatting. It would also be helpful if you include as much relevant information as
possible. This could include screenshots, code snippets etc.
