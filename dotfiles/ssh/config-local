### Multiplex SSH connections that go through the same host
# This speeds up scp, tab completion tremendously. But downside
# is that you have lower bandwidth for concurrent copies. Also
# killing master session with Ctrl-C will drop all child sessions.
# Also there might be some issues with stale port forwarding
#
# Here is an example of using ControlMaster when all SSH
# connections need to go through some Bastion host
#Host dev
#    HostName some-bastion-host
#    Controlpath ~/.ssh/control-master/ssh-%r@%h:%p.sock
#    Controlpath ~/.ssh/control-master/%r@%n.sock
#    ControlMaster auto
#    ControlPersist 10m
#Host *.dev
#    ProxyCommand ssh %r@dev -W $(echo %h | awk '{ gsub(/.dev$/, "some-internal-host-pattern", $1); print $1}'):%p
